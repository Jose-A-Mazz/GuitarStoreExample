# This is a small JavaScript project where users can select their favorite guitar combination and see their prices. The project is incomplete and its aim is to show my beginner coding skills. The link to the live Page is here: https://jose-a-mazz.github.io/GuitarStoreExample/

What does this project include?

1. A very basic JavaScript carousel with fading-in and fading-out transitions
2. Live guitar prices based on the selected components
3. A Bootstrap navbar with changing-style as the user scrolls up and down the page
